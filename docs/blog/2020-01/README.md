### The Rules

How did we do this month?

### Our Day

My husband Will rolled over in the morning and immediately reached for his phone. "Hold up..." I said, "The script finally decided it's our tech sabbatical day. You can't use your phone." "What?" he said sleepily, "But I just need to make sure I don't have any messages...". At that point I had a feeling it was going to be more difficult than we had imagined, but I was pleasantly surprised. 

I had woken up earlier and reached for my phone only to see one critical notification - we had a new calendar event that hadn't been there when we went to bed letting us know today was the random day chosen this month for our digital sabbatical. It was an idea we had been talking about for a while... as developers, we both love technology, but something about the idea of taking a little break from it was becoming more and more appealing. However, having laid in bed unable to engage in my normal cycle of reddit-instagram-gaming waiting for Will to wake up I was already unsure about how long until I cracked. 

It was then we encountered our first challenge of the day: our newly installed smart blinds. Did opening them with our voices count as cheating or not? We decided not, but we couldn't quite put our fingers on why that felt ok (but as the day progressed this theme became clearer). 

With nothing to distract us, we got out of bed much faster than usual. As soon as I walked into the kitchen I immediately started cleaning out the kitchen cupboards because what better to do with my newfound time than tidy a drawer that's been driving me crazy forever?! When I finished up and wandered into the living room I discovered Will sitting on the sofa staring out the window twirling a piece of string from one of the dog's toys in his finger. "Have you been playing with that string the entire time I was making coffee?" I asked. Clearly entertaining ourselves without our morning Youtube rabbit hole was going to be more hilarious than we had anticipated!

Not getting sucked down the rabbit hole of Youtube was one of my primary selling features of the digital sabbatical. Don't get me wrong - I love spending hours filling my brain with the latest international food tour/life hack/late night clip, but we recognized a while back just how little we have to _talk about_ afterwards... and how easy it is to just never stop watching until your whole day is gone. 

Our place felt awkwardly silent without the sound track of the television, but Will settled into his happy hipster place by putting on his record player and we settled into breakfast and coffee with a nice musical accompanyment. Perhaps we could handle this after all?

> Am I going to need to bring the egg timer to the gym with me?!

We began to plan our day, and  Will decided to further embrace his hipsterism and take his analog camera out for a spin while I opted to head to the gym. "You can't use your smart watch to time yourself though" said my stickler husband. "Am I going to have to bring the egg timer with me then?!" I laughed. We decided the machines at the gym didn't count as cheating. 

Lunch was the first major challenge of our day. Usually we are _that_ modern couple, enjoying our meal mostly in silence while we scroll endlessly on our phones. When we talked about it afterwards, we both weren't totally sure how the meal was going to go and how tempting it might be to check our phones. We've been together for over 15 years... did we really have anything left to say to each other?! Surprisingly we did and although I don't remember what we talked about it was a pleasant conversation without too much awkward dead air. 

Our afternoon and evening activities weren't too difficult this month. We walked around downtown, a typical weekend activity for us before heading home to walk our dogs. We did have to add one new rule along the way - using our voice interfaces to _remotely_ control our smart home devices was taking the 'voice activation is fine if there is no screen' rule a bit too far. Ultimately, we landed on voice activation is fine if there is no screen and it's a direct equivalent to an analog action. Yes, we do live in the future #2020. 

We did run into one moment of challenge as we started to head out to our friends place for an evening of drinking and games. We suddenly realized that we no longer had a phone book in the house, and would have to rely on our memories for both their address and the cab phone number. Thanks to a long stint in retail we both still remembered a cab number and managed to dredge up our friend's street enough to get the cabbie there. It was interesting to imagine future generations who will never have had the experience of not having a digital device to fall back to, and how that will change our societal expectations in the future. 

Resisting our phones while sipping beer and playing games was not at all a challenge, but the moment the clocked ticked over to end our day we both immediately picked our phones up and began checking our messages. 

### Debriefing

I would consider our first day to have been a strong success. We both thought that we would feel a little bit of FOMO without being connected, and that we would catch ourselves reaching for our phones out of reflex, but we were pleasantly surprised on both things. 

Although we both did catch ourselves reaching for our phones a few times, it was actually far easier than we thought to resist because we hadn't started our day in our normal routine and so we just never got into that habit. 

I don't think we realized quite how much of our attention went to maintaining and continuously checking into the black hole of the internet with very little return on our investment. In the following days I really became aware of how I would open my phone to accomplish one task and then find myself five, ten, thirty minutes later still sucked in and doing something else entirely. 

I also don't think we realized how much we're often splitting our attention further, by not only watching something on television and being on our phones so that if one of us wants to talk to the other one it becomes too much and the conversation feels like an interruption.

Being free of the technology tornado for a day was surprisingly freeing, and we are definitely looking forward to the next month.
